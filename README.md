In this project, I uploaded how I solved Euler Project Problems. All problems are taken by this website: https://projecteuler.net/about I spent a lot of hours in 1.5 weeks and I solved 15 of them. This is also the reason why there are also Project Failures. I included my mistakes and codes I wrote which are enjoyful. In this way, I can see my mistakes more clearly. After my exams finish, I will continue to upload. I would like to thank Project Euler creators and I hope my trials can be useful for someone else. May the force be with you Orcun Edit: 28.12.2020 I solved 2 of them and updated the questions I solved so there are 17 answers now.
